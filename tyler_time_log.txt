Time log for pre project - Tyler Turnbull

==========================================================

Activity: Got the -r and -f functions to print the contents
	of the file. However, I had a few issues parsing the data.

	First the hidden commas within " " are causing issue. 
	Second, no matter how I use fscanf i seem to be dumping
	everything it collects into one variable. Probably a 
	simple workaround here but my knowledge of c is holding me 
	back. 

	I believe if we can implement a struct, such as:

	struct {
	int ref_date;
	char[] geo;
	char[] viewer;
	char[] content;
	char[] program;
	char[] vector;
	float value;
	}

	Then we just need to parse the data into an array or list,
	or whatever works best in c. If it were java I would just 
	create an object to model the data and use an ArrayList<ObjectName>.

	Will have to pick my teams c brains and see if they know anymore than 
	I do.
